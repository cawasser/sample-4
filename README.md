generated using Luminus version "3.83"


## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

[1]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To start the web server for the application, in a terminal/powershell run:

    lein run 

To start the client server, in a terminal powershell run `npm install`.
When that finishes, run: 
    
    shadow-cljs watch app

This will spin up the clientside server hosting the webpage.
You should now be able to open a browser window to `localhost:3000`
and see the luminus homepage with various welcome banners.

**DO NOT run lein shadow watch app whatsoever, this will re-generate the shadow-cljs.edn
config file and could have unexpected side-effects.**
